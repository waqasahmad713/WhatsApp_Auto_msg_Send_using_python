# WhatsApp_Auto_msg_Send_using_python
Instructions:
Install the library using pip install pywhatkit.
Make sure you are logged in to WhatsApp Web on your browser.
Replace 'phone_number_with_country_code' with the recipient's phone number (including the country code).
Replace 'Your message here' with the text of the message you want to send.
Replace hour and min with the desired hour and minute to schedule the message (in 24-hour format).
Run the Python script, and the message will be automatically sent at the specified time.
Note:
Ensure that the recipient's phone number is valid and active on WhatsApp.
If the message scheduling doesn't work, double-check the phone number format and ensure that your system's time is accurate.
The library may get updated over time, so refer to the official documentation for any changes or additional features.
Important:
Sending automated messages may be subject to restrictions and policies imposed by WhatsApp. Use this functionality responsibly and only for legitimate purposes. Automated messaging may also be subject to rate limits and other restrictions imposed by WhatsApp. Be aware of the terms of service of WhatsApp and use the library accordingly.
